<h1>DNS and DHCP</h1>

<p>
Vac-in-a-Box (ViaB) maintains a list of the factory machines in each of the
spaces which in turn form a ViaB site. For each factory, the DNS hostname
and MAC and IP addresses are recorded. Each factory has a copy of this
information and uses it to build its /etc/hosts file and the configuration
of its built-in DHCP service and Squid cache. These network settings are
required when creating hosts on the ViaB website, which is done from the
space configuration page.

<p>
Consequently, it is not a requirement that ViaB factory machines are
registered with your site's DNS servers, although it is good practice and
convenient to do so. You may even find that some Grid services reject 
requests from VMs on factories without matching DNS A and PTR records, as
the requests appear to come from the factory itself due to Vac's internal NAT
networking. Even then, it is not a requirement that the registered host
names match those used when defining the ViaB site.

<h2>DHCP and DNS during installation</h2>

<p>
When a ViaB factory machine boots up without a USB stick present, it uses PXE 
and TFTP to begin a modified version of the Scientific Linux install
procedure. DHCP is used to obtain the registered IP address based on the
factory's MAC address, and the response from the first neighbouring factory
to reply is used. Typically this replying factory will be the least loaded 
machine.
In normal operation, all of the factories' DHCP servers would respond with the 
same IP address for a given MAC address. However, the DHCP server also 
instructs the reinstalling factory to contact the TFTP service on the replying
factory (which has the quickest DHCP server.) In turn, the files on that TFTP
service instruct the reinstalling factory to use the Squid cache on the
replying factory to fetch the images and RPMs needed for reinstallation.
This &quot;DHCP race&quot; procedure produces a good degree of load balancing 
and fault tolerance across replying factories.

<p>
Once the factory has finished reinstallation, it reboots into the installed
operating system and obtains its IP address from DHCP again and looks up the
corresponding hostname in its own /etc/hosts file. It now uses its internal
Squid cache for RPM updates and for cvmfs requests from its VMs.

<h2>Changing hostnames and IP or MAC addresses</h2>

<p>
If you need to change the registered network details of a factory, you must 
update them on the website, republish the relevant space's configuration RPM
and wait one hour for the new RPM to propogate to all of the other factories.
This ensures that all of the DHCP, /etc/hosts, and Squid access control files 
have been updated. You can then reboot the affected factory(s) which will
be able to successfully install from their remaining neighbours. 

<h2>Nameservers</h2>

<p>
Alongside the question of what to register with the site's DNS service, the
factories need access to nameservers to look up other addresses outside the
Vac space. These are set within the Subnets section of the form to
configure the space in question. If the site's nameservers are not suitable,
then the Google nameservers &quot;8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4&quot; are a viable substitute.
However, if the site has a restrictive firewall, there may be no option but
to use the officially permitted nameservers.

<h2>Co-existing with other DHCP services</h2>

<p>
The ViaB DHCP server configuration is designed to work alongside any
existing DHCP service at a site. The site DHCP servers should be configured
to ignore the ViaB factory machines' MAC addresses. In many cases
this is done by just omitting them from the white list of registered MAC
addresses the local DHCP service will respond to. The ViaB DHCP servers are
configured to give non-authoritative responses to MAC addresses they don't
recognise, which tells that machine to keep trying to find an IP address
elsewhere.

<p>
If it is not possible to prevent a local site DHCP service from responding
to ViaB factory machines for some political or administrative reason, then
the service should be configured with the same set of IP and MAC addresses
as registered on the the ViaB website. In addition, the host entry in the
DHCP configuration must include 
<pre>filename "pxelinux.0"</pre>
and
<pre>next-server HOSTNAME</pre>
options, where HOSTNAME is one of your factories. This scenario
introduces that machine as a single point of failure, and a potential
bottleneck as installation HTTP activity must go through its Squid cache.
This factory must itself be reinstalled with a USB stick whenever that is 
necessary. 

<p>
If you are unable to get changes made to the site DHCP service, then it is
also possible to install every factory at a site one-by-one with a USB stick.
