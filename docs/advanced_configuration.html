<h1>Advanced configuration</h1>

<p>
This page explains some advanced topics which are not normally needed.

<h2>Advanced network settings for spaces</h2>

<p>
On the configuration page for each space within a site is a section with
advanced settings relating to networking. These settings will apply to all
factories within a site and can be applied by republishing the configuration
RPM. Unlike changes to the subnets, reinstallation is not required.

<p>
<b>NAT IPs</b> is a space separated list of IP addresses which will be
allowed to request files from the ViaB webserver. Normally only the
IP addresses allocated to factories are accepted, but if the factories
are on a NAT network, then they will be making requests with the NAT
gateway's address(es).

<p>
If <b>Kickstart network arguments</b> is given, then a network option
will be added to the kickstart files used during installation with
the arguments given by this setting. This can be used to bond network
inferfaces, for example.

<p>
<b>Site cvmfs proxies</b> is a space separated list of the URLs of 
additional HTTP proxies to pass to the VMs. The VMs are always informed
of the Squid caching proxy running on each factory. Note: this is 
<b>not</b> a CernVM-FS multiple proxies expression with semicolons and
pipes; it is just a space separated list of URLs.

<p>
<b>Extra lines for /etc/hosts</b> will be appended to /etc/hosts on
the factories, and is in the normal /etc/hosts format, with each
line being IPADDRESS HOST1 HOST2 ... As the VMs use the DNS server
on each factory, which first looks at /etc/hosts, then these lines
can be used to override the IP addresses used by applications within
VMs to achieve particular routing choices.
