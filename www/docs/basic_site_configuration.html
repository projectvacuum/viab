<h1>Basic site configuration</h1>

<p>
This page explains how to create a basic configuration of a Vac-in-a-Box
(ViaB) site for testing, with the intention to add real experiments'
details once everything is working. The instructions are easier to
understand if you go through them while looking
at the <a href="/admin/">ViaB admin website</a>.

<p>
To get started with a new ViaB site, you should ask the ViaB
admins (currently Andrew McNab) to add it to the ViaB website and give the
X.509 DNs of the people who should have admin rights over your site. The
site must use its existing name in the GOCDB  
(eg CERN or UKI-NORTHGRID-MAN-HEP) within ViaB too.

<p>
The site will then be created and listed on the <a href="/admin/">All
Vac-in-a-Box sites</a> page. With your X.509 certificate loaded in your
browser you can navigate the blank configuration for your new site.

<h2>Add a space and ssh keys</h2>

<p>
From your site's main page, add a space to contain a set of similar
factory machines. Spaces are equivalent to Compute
Elements at CREAM or ARC based sites. A space name must take the form of a
lowercase DNS name. It should be within DNS space you are entitled to use
but does not really have to be registered in it. Currently, it is only used
as a unique identifier with CE-like syntax.

<p>
To be able to ssh into the factory machines at your site, you should add
one or more ssh RSA public keys to the site's configuration. These will be
used to make the /root/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the factories. The
public key takes the form of the long, second string on each line of an ssh
.authorized_keys or id_rsa.pub file.

<h2>Add factories and subnets</h2>

<p>
Next go to the page about the space you have created. This has information
about when the space's configuration RPM was last published, and a link
to the .iso image you can put on a USB stick to install the first 
factory.

<p>
But before that, add at least one and ideally about three factories in the
&quot;Factories in this space&quot; section. You will need to supply the
hostname, IP and MAC addresses. The defaults for the other settings are
sufficient for testing, but you will probably want to increase
total_machines and cpu_total to match the number of logical processors on
your factory machines. You can edit all of these settings on the factory's
own page. The default value of these settings are also based on the factory
you've edited most recently in this space.

<p>
To set up the network environment for the factories you must also define 
one or more subnets. The system will automatically take care of using the 
right subnet details for a given factory. So for example, if you have a
factory with IP address 192.168.1.9 then subnet 192.168.1.0 with netmask 
255.255.255.0 and router 192.168.1.250 would be set up when 192.168.1.9 is
installed. 

<p>
You also need to give the nameservers to be used by all factories within
that subnet. Nameservers must be given in a comma separated list. If you're
unsure what to use, then Google's 8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 will problably work unless
you have a restrictive firewall.

<h2>Add a vmtype</h2>

<p>
Next define the example vmtype. This is the configuration for a type of VM
that the factory will be able to create. Enter &quot;example&quot; as the 
name of the vmtype in the form and add it to the space.

<p>
Now go to the page about the example vmtype and use the Add Preset button
for the example vmtype. You should now see a list of options for the vmtype,
including:
<ul>
<li>user_data_option_cvmfs_proxy = http://169.254.169.254:3128
<li>root_image = https://www.gridpp.ac.uk/vac/example/cernvm3.iso
<li>user_data = https://www.gridpp.ac.uk/vac/example/user_data
<li>target_share = 1.0
</ul>

<p>
You do not need to modify the options or upload a .p12 file as the example 
vmtype doesn't use one.

<h2>Doing a first install</h2>

<p>
Go back to the page about the space you defined and click on Publish. The
date and time of last publication should update to now. The webserver is
now ready to respond to requests from factories for the configuration
details you have set. 

<p>
To install the first factory machines, download the USB .iso image file and
read the page about <a href="usb_and_pxe_installation">USB and PXE 
installation</a>.
