<h1>Vac-in-a-Box overview</h1>

<p>
The central idea with Vac-in-a-Box (ViaB) is to operate a site as a
collection of almost identical machines, each of which provide all the
services needed to run the site. The avoids any headnode or gatekeeper,
any configuration master, and dedicated servers like Squid caches.

<p>
The configuration has to come from somewhere, and this role is fulfilled
by the viab.gridpp.ac.uk website, with the configuration of each site
created and maintained via web forms. 

<p>
The configuration details are obtained by each physical machine at the site
in the form of the viab-conf RPM from a YUM repository on the website. This
is done automatically and asynchronously using YUM, which means if the
website is temporarily unavailable the physical machines carry on working
with their existing configuration.

<p>
Once installed, the physical machines operate as Vac VM
factories, and the machines are referred to as factories in Vac terminology.
A group of factories which communicate load information to each other are
referred to as &quot;space&quot;. Each space also has one or more
&quot;vmtypes&quot; associated with it which define the properties of a
type of VM, usually one vmtype per experiment.

<p>
A site can contain one or more spaces, and sites are referred to using their
GOCDB names, such as CERN or UKI-NORTHGRID-MAN-HEP. In ViaB, each site has a
list of admins identified by X.509 DN who can modify the site's
configuration.
