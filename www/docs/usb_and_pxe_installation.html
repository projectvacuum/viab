<h1>USB and PXE installation</h1>

<p>
Once you have created a 
<a href="basic_configuration">basic configuration</a> of your site on the 
website, you
can publish the configuration RPM and download the USB .iso image that
publishing also creates. You then need to write the .iso image to a USB
memory stick. The procedure differs by operating system, but there is a
<a href="http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/InstallFromUSBkey">CentOS wiki
page</a> explaining how to do it: ViaB uses the RHEL/CentOS/SL 6.6
installer code and the .iso image can be written directly with dd. If a 
CD/DVD drive is present, the image can burnt to a CD-ROM disc as an
alternative.

<p>
You should also configure the BIOS to boot from USB (or CD/DVD) if available, 
then try PXE or network, then try the first hard drive.

<p>
Boot the first factory from the USB stick but make sure you remove the stick
as soon as initrd.img has finished loading and before the hardware
initialization message. If you don't do this, the USB device is likely to be
treated as /dev/sda, preventing the real disk(s) from being configured and
probably resulting in the corruption of the USB stick. If this happens, you
will need to rewrite the image to the stick.

<p>
The boot image is a slightly modified version of the Scientific Linux 6
installer. It will ask you for network settings twice, and then proceed with
an automatic installation and reboot. 

<p>
For the second machine, do not use the USB stick. Let it boot via PXE
from the first factory. The installation proceeds as before but this time
without even the need to give the network settings. The SL6 images and RPMs
are downloaded via the Squid cache of the 
first factory to answer the DHCP query.
Since ViaB runs the Squids with peering, RPMs already cached on any of the
factories will be fetched locally rather than downloaded into your site
again. 

<p>
The ViaB factories reboot once installation is complete but use kexec to go
straight to booting Linux from the hard drive rather than loop through PXE
again. The factory then runs normally, starting VMs etc. If there is another
reboot, it will result in booting via PXE, one automated reinstallation, and
then back to running normally. 

<p>
For the third and subsequent machines, installation should go much faster as
the SL6 RPMs and images will have been cached in the Squid server(s). If you
need to reinstall the first factory, you do not need to use the USB stick
instead of PXE as long as at least one other factory is up and running
correctly.
