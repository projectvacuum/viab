<h1>Vac-in-a-Box</h1>

<p>
Vac-in-a-Box (ViaB) aims to make it ridiculously easy to install and
configure Vac on your computers. 
<a href="http://www.gridpp.ac.uk/vac/">Vac</a> 
allows you to run VMs from HEP
experiments to run their jobs, and ViaB allows you to manage the Vac VM
factory machines and the VM settings here on the ViaB website. This way you
don't need to use Puppet or configure things manually 
(Vac's <a
href="https://www.gridpp.ac.uk/vac/versions/current/doc/admin-guide.html">Admin
 Guide</a> explains how to go down that route if you prefer.)

<p>
The factory machines managed by ViaB are autonomous and equivalent, and each
one runs all the
services needed for installation and operation at your site: DHCP, TFTP,
Squid, and Vac. You install the first factory using a USB boot image you can
download from this website, and subsequent factories can be installed from
the first (and second, and third ...) factory using PXE. 

<p>
Even though the factories are self-contained, they co-operate to supply each
other with DHCP and TFTP services at boot time, and participate in a
distributed HTTP cache via Squid peering. This cache is used during
installations and by cvmfs. Once Vac is running on a factory it also queries
the other factories via the VacQuery UDP protocol to decide what types of VM
to start.
